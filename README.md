# Visual Studio â€“ Application Development

Unfortunately, I am not able to attach any screens from the application because the library that I used in a client application is out of date and Visual Studio cannot compile it.

An achievement I am proud of: Starting with an empty solution and I have managed to develop the server that can handle multiple client threads as well as my very own packet data that was effectively used in communication.

 * The server that handles multiple threads
 * Designed client-server communication
 * Console based server application
 * Windows forms based client application
 * Database driven client application
